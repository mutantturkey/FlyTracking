README

This contains all of the source codes used for the Fly Tracking project.

You will find a few scripts to automate the processing of the data:

./process-video-beta
./batch-process

You will find a few programs, FilterFlyMask, FlyTracking, and mask-generator
in fly-tools. You will need to 'make' them which is easy to do. If you have
trouble building, please make sure that you have gsl and ImageMagick++ and
the MagickWand libraries and headers installed.

$ cd fly-data
$ make

The programs that will be built are located here:

./fly-tools/FilterFlyMask
./fly-tools/FlyTracking
./fly-tools/mask-generator

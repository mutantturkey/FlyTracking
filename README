README

This contains all of the source codes used for the Fly Tracking project.

You will find a few scripts to automate the processing of the data:

./process-video-beta
./batch-process

You will find two programs, FilterFlyMask and FlyTracking in fly-tools. You
will need to make them which is easy to do. If you have trouble building, 
please make sure that you have gsl and ImageMagick++ libraries and headers
installed.

$ cd fly-data
$ make

The programs that will be build are located here:

./fly-tools/FilterFlyMask
./fly-tools/FlyTracking

More documentation is included in the README file in fly-tools/
